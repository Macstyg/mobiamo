              <p>Mobiamo is a mobile payments platform developed by Paymentwall with a global network of more than 150 mobile carriers. It allows merchants to accept mobile payments for  digital goods and services through premium SMS billing, mobile subscriptions, direct carrier and WAP billing. Mobiamo can be used in mobile apps and games, free-to-play games, in-app purchases. With its software development kit (SDK), developers can integrate Mobiamo in both iOS and Android apps.</p>
              <p>Currently, Mobiamo is available in over 80 countries, and accepts payments in over 55 currencies. With this global coverage and multi-platform availability, Mobiamo allows merchants to maximize their revenue from mobile payments and boost conversion rates up to 90 percent. As such, the demand has grown for Mobiamo, prompting it to expand its team to be able to serve a growing number of merchants, mobile carriers and end-users.</p>
              <p>Due to this stronger demand, Mobiamo has announced independence from Paymentwall in October 2015 and is now operating as an independent company. The separation will allow Mobiamo to enhance its management process and become more flexible in its operations.</p>
